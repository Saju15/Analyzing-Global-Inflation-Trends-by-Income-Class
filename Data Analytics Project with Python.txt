Data Analytics Project with Python 

My interest --> Dataset from the world bank.
Indicator --> Inflation, consumer prices (annual %)

Data cleaning -> don't need indicator code since we are focusing on one economic indicator
Years -> data available from 1960 to make it easier lets focus on 1998 - 2022 (last 25 years)

Datasets source : (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG?view=chart)
